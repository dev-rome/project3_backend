# Pro-folio BackEnd

## About The Project

Personal Project Management. The application will create a way for our team, as well as other developers, to market themselves through an app that is designed to showcase your personal projects all on one main page with links to individual project pages. The app will contain contact information including links to resumes, cover letters, gitHub, LinkedIn, etc.
